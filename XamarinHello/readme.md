# Xamarin to Arduino BLE via nRF52

## Stand-up Shiny 2.x

Coming soon... this is a pain.

## Linux Bluetooth

WARNING: This is a work-in-progress (WIP)

The project aims to provide an example of connecting to BLE controllers in a Linux environment via the D-Bus (Linux message bus system).

It is based off of the works of DotNet-BlueZ and other implementations.
